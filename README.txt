### NOTES DEC 2

Driver broken into sections by age function. Each section sweeps relevant parameter and stores network. 

Plotting enabled to get an idea of how parameters affect the networks.

Network size held constant across all settings.

To be done: 
-implement normalized Poisson aging
-calculate network features
-add/adjust analysis as needed
-figure generation of network features
