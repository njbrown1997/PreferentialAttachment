### NOTES DEC 2

Driver broken into sections by age function. Each section sweeps relevant parameter and stores network. 

Network size held constant across all settings.

To be done: 
-implement normalized Poisson aging
-calculate network features
-add/adjust analysis as needed
-figure generation of network features
